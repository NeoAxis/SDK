            <summary>
            Abstract class defining the interface to be implemented by particle affectors.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            Particle affectors modify particles in a particle system over their lifetime. They can be
            grouped into types, e.g. 'vector force' affectors, 'fader' affectors etc; each type will 
            modify particles in a different way, using different parameters.
            </para>
            <para>
            Because there are so many types of affectors you could use, Engine chooses not to dictate
            the available types. It comes with some in-built, but allows plugins or applications to extend the 
            affector types available.
            This is done by subclassing ParticleAffector to have the appropriate emission behaviour you want,
            and also creating a subclass of ParticleAffectorFactory which is responsible for creating instances 
            of your new affector type. You register this factory with the ParticleSystemManager using
            addAffectorFactory, and from then on affectors of this type can be created either from code or through
            text particle scripts by naming the type.
            </para>
            <para>
            This same approach is used for ParticleEmitters (which are the source of particles in a system).
            This means that Engine is particularly flexible when it comes to creating particle system effects,
            with literally infinite combinations of affector and affector types, and paramters within those
            types.

            This class defines a ParticleAffector which applies a linear force to particles in a system.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            This affector applies a linear force, such as gravity, to a particle system.
            This force can be applied in 2 ways: by taking the average of the particle's current momentum and the 
            force vector, or by adding the force vector to the current particle's momentum. 
            </para>
            <para>
            The former approach is self-stabilising i.e. once a particle's momentum
            is equal to the force vector, no further change is made to it's momentum. It also results in
            a non-linear acceleration of particles.
            The latter approach is simpler and applies a constant acceleration to particles. However,
            it is not self-stabilising and can lead to perpetually increasing particle velocities.

            <remarks>
            <para>
            Vertex animation comes in 2 types, morph and pose. The reason
            for the 2 types is that we have 2 different potential goals - to encapsulate
            a complete, flowing morph animation with multiple keyframes (a typical animation,
            but implemented by having snapshots of the vertex data at each keyframe), 
            or to represent a single pose change, for example a facial expression. 
            Whilst both could in fact be implemented using the same system, we choose
            to separate them since the requirements and limitations of each are quite
            different.
            </para>
            <para>
            Morph animation is a simple approach where we have a whole series of 
            snapshots of vertex data which must be interpolated, e.g. a running 
            animation implemented as morph targets. Because this is based on simple
            snapshots, it's quite fast to use when animating an entire mesh because 
            it's a simple linear change between keyframes. However, this simplistic 
            approach does not support blending between multiple morph animations. 
            If you need animation blending, you are advised to use skeletal animation
            for full-mesh animation, and pose animation for animation of subsets of 
            meshes or where skeletal animation doesn't fit - for example facial animation.
            For animating in a vertex shader, morph animation is quite simple and 
            just requires the 2 vertex buffers (one the original position buffer) 
            of absolute position data, and an interpolation factor. Each track in 
            a morph animation refrences a unique set of vertex data.
            </para>
            <para>
            Pose animation is more complex. Like morph animation each track references
            a single unique set of vertex data, but unlike morph animation, each 
            keyframe references 1 or more 'poses', each with an influence level. 
            A pose is a series of offsets to the base vertex data, and may be sparse - ie it
            may not reference every vertex. Because they're offsets, they can be 
            blended - both within a track and between animations. This set of features
            is very well suited to facial animation.
            </para>
            <para>
            For example, let's say you modelled a face (one set of vertex data), and 
            defined a set of poses which represented the various phonetic positions 
            of the face. You could then define an animation called 'SayHello', containing
            a single track which referenced the face vertex data, and which included 
            a series of keyframes, each of which referenced one or more of the facial 
            positions at different influence levels - the combination of which over
            time made the face form the shapes required to say the word 'hello'. Since
            the poses are only stored once, but can be referenced may times in 
            many animations, this is a very powerful way to build up a speech system.
            </para>
            <para>
            The downside of pose animation is that it can be more difficult to set up.
            Also, since it uses more buffers (one for the base data, and one for each
            active pose), if you're animating in hardware using vertex shaders you need
            to keep an eye on how many poses you're blending at once. You define a
            maximum supported number in your vertex program definition, see the 
            includes_pose_animation material script entry. 
            </para>
            <para>
            So, by partitioning the vertex animation approaches into 2, we keep the
            simple morph technique easy to use, whilst still allowing all 
            the powerful techniques to be used. Note that morph animation cannot
            be blended with other types of vertex animation (pose animation or other
            morph animation); pose animation can be blended with other pose animation
            though, and both types can be combined with skeletal animation. Also note
            that all morph animation can be expressed as pose animation, but not vice
            versa.

            It is better to create KeyFrames in time order. Creating them out of order can result

            for you, so you don't need to create this one.

            Why do we have this binding list rather than just have <see cref="T:Engine.Renderer.VertexElement"/> referring to the
            vertex buffers direct? Well, in the underlying APIs, binding the vertex buffers to an
            index (or 'stream') is the way that vertex data is linked, so this structure better
            reflects the realities of that. In addition, by separating the vertex declaration from
            the list of vertex buffer bindings, it becomes possible to reuse bindings between declarations
            and vice versa, giving opportunities to reduce the state changes required to perform rendering.

            <para>
            Texture color operations determine how the final color of the surface appears when
            rendered. Texture units are used to combine color values from various sources (ie. the
            diffuse color of the surface from lighting calculations, combined with the color of
            the texture). This method allows you to specify the 'operation' to be used, ie. the
            calculation such as adds or multiplies, and which values to use as arguments, such as
            a fixed value or a value from a previous calculation.
            </para>
            <para>
            The defaults for each layer are:
            <ul>
            <li>operation = Modulate</li>
            <li>source1 = Texture</li>
            <li>source2 = Current</li>
            </ul>
            ie. each layer takes the color results of the previous layer, and multiplies them
            with the new texture being applied. Bear in mind that colors are RGB values from
            0.0 - 1.0 so multiplying them together will result in values in the same range,
            'tinted' by the multiply. Note however that a straight multiply normally has the
            effect of darkening the textures - for this reason there are brightening operations
            like ModulateX2. See the <see cref="T:Engine.Renderer.LayerBlendOperation"/> and 
            <see cref="T:Engine.Renderer.LayerBlendSource"/> enumerated types for full details.

            <para>
            The final 3 parameters are only required if you decide to pass values manually
            into the operation, i.e. you want one or more of the inputs to the color calculation
            to come from a fixed value that you supply. Hence you only need to fill these in if
            you supply "Manual" to the corresponding source, or use the "BlendManual"
            operation.

            <para>
            Ogre tries to use multitexturing hardware to blend texture layers
            together. However, if it runs out of texturing units (e.g. 2 of a GeForce2, 4 on a
            GeForce3) it has to fall back on multipass rendering, i.e. rendering the same object
            multiple times with different textures. This is both less efficient and there is a smaller
            range of blending operations which can be performed. For this reason, if you use this method
            you MUST also call <see cref="M:Engine.Renderer.TextureUnitState.SetColorOpMultipassFallback(Engine.Renderer.SceneBlendFactor,Engine.Renderer.SceneBlendFactor)"/> to specify 
            which effect you want to fall back on if sufficient hardware is not available.

            blending options but sets up the multipass fallback automatically,

            <remarks>
            <para>
            A 'hardware buffer' is any area of memory held outside of core system ram,
            and in our case refers mostly to video ram, although in theory this class
            could be used with other memory areas such as sound card memory, custom
            coprocessor memory etc.
            </para>
            <para>
            This reflects the fact that memory held outside of main system RAM must 
            be interacted with in a more formal fashion in order to promote
            cooperative and optimal usage of the buffers between the various 
            processing units which manipulate them.
            </para>
            <para>
            This abstract class defines the core interface which is common to all
            buffers, whether it be vertex buffers, index buffers, texture memory
            or framebuffer memory etc.
            </para>
            <para>
            Buffers have the ability to be 'shadowed' in system memory, this is because
            the kinds of access allowed on hardware buffers is not always as flexible as
            that allowed for areas of system memory - for example it is often either 
            impossible, or extremely undesirable from a performance standpoint to read from
            a hardware buffer; when writing to hardware buffers, you should also write every
            byte and do it sequentially. In situations where this is too restrictive, 
            it is possible to create a hardware, write-only buffer (the most efficient kind) 
            and to back it with a system memory 'shadow' copy which can be read and updated arbitrarily.
            Ogre handles synchronising this buffer with the real hardware buffer (which should still be
            created with the <b>Usage.Dynamic</b> flag if you intend to update it very frequently). Whilst this
            approach does have it's own costs, such as increased memory overhead, these costs can 
            often be outweighed by the performance benefits of using a more hardware efficient buffer.
            You should look for the 'useShadowBuffer' parameter on the creation methods used to create
            the buffer of the type you require (see <see cref="T:Engine.Renderer.HardwareBufferManager"/>) to enable this feature.

            <remarks>
            <para>
            A billboard chain operates much like a traditional billboard, ie its
            segments always face the camera; the difference being that instead of
            a set of disconnected quads, the elements in this class are connected
            together in a chain which must always stay in a continuous strip. This
            kind of effect is useful for creating effects such as trails, beams,
            lightning effects, etc.
            </para>
            <para>
            A single instance of this class can actually render multiple separate
            chain segments in a single render operation, provided they all use the
            same material. To clarify the terminology: a 'segment' is a separate 
            sub-part of the chain with its own start and end (called the 'head'
            and the 'tail'. An 'element' is a single position / colour / texcoord
            entry in a segment. You can add items to the head of a chain, and 
            remove them from the tail, very efficiently. Each segment has a max
            size, and if adding an element to the segment would exceed this size, 
            the tail element is automatically removed and re-used as the new item
            on the head.
            </para>
            <para>
            This class has no auto-updating features to do things like alter the
            colour of the elements or to automatically add / remove elements over
            time - you have to do all this yourself as a user of the class. 
            Subclasses can however be used to provide this kind of behaviour 
            automatically.

            material the pass may be split into multiple passes if the graphics card cannot
            handle the number of texture units requested. For passes with fragment programs, however, 
            the number of passes you create will never be altered, so you have to make sure 
            that you create an alternative fallback Technique for if a card does not have

            to allow a user to pick a performance / quality ratio. Another
            possibility is that you have a fully HDR-enabled pipeline for top
            machines, rendering all objects using unclamped shaders, and a 
            simpler pipeline for others; this can be implemented using 
            schemes.

            Billboards are rectangles made up of 2 tris which are always facing the given direction. They are typically used
            for special effects like particles. This class collects together a set of billboards with the same (default) dimensions,
            material and relative locality in order to process them more efficiently. The entire set of billboards will be
            culled as a whole (by default, although this can be changed if you want a large set of billboards
            which are spread out and you want them culled individually), individual Billboards have locations which are relative to the set (which itself derives it's
            position from the SceneNode it is attached to since it is a <see cref="T:Engine.Renderer.MovableObject"/>), 
            they will be rendered as a single rendering operation,

            Billboard sets are always culled as a whole group, based on a bounding box which 
            encloses all billboards in the set. For fairly localised sets, this is enough. However, you
            can optionally tell the set to also cull individual billboards in the set, i.e. to test
            each individual billboard before rendering. The default is not to do this.
            </para>
            <para>
            This is useful when you have a large, fairly distributed set of billboards, like maybe 
            trees on a landscape. You probably still want to group them into more than one
            set (maybe one set per section of landscape), which will be culled coarsely, but you also
            want to cull the billboards individually because they are spread out. Whilst you could have
            lots of single-tree sets which are culled separately, this would be inefficient to render
            because each tree would be issued as it's own rendering operation.
            </para>
            <para>
            By calling this method with a parameter of true, you can have large billboard sets which 
            are spaced out and so get the benefit of batch rendering and coarse culling, but also have
            fine-grained culling so unnecessary rendering is avoided.

            The default sort of billboard (<b>Point</b>), always has both x and y axes parallel to 
            the camera's local axes. This is fine for 'point' style billboards (e.g. flares,
            smoke, anything which is symmetrical about a central point) but does not look good for
            billboards which have an orientation (e.g. an elongated raindrop). In this case, the
            oriented billboards are more suitable (<b>OrientedCommon</b> or <b>OrientedSelf</b>) since
            they retain an independant Y axis and only the X axis is generated, perpendicular to both
            the local Y and the camera Z.
            </para>
            <para>
            In some case you might want the billboard has fixed Z axis and doesn't need to face to
            camera (e.g. an aureola around the player and parallel to the ground). You can use
            <b>PerpendicularSelf</b> which the billboard plane perpendicular to the billboard own
            direction. Or <b>PerpendicularCommon</b> which the billboard plane perpendicular to the
            common direction.

            The common direction also use in <b>PerpendicularCommon</b>, in this case the common direction

            axis.

            In this case, we need an additional up-vector to determine the billboard X and Y axis.
            The generated billboard plane and X-axis guarantee perpendicular to specify direction.

            <para>

        <member name="P:Engine.Renderer.BillboardSet.AccurateFacing">
            <summary>
            Gets whether or not billboards use an 'accurate' facing model
            based on the vector from each billboard to the camera, rather than 
            an optimised version using just the camera direction.			
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            By default, the axes for all billboards are calulated using the 
            camera's view direction, not the vector from the camera position to
            the billboard. The former is faster, and most of the time the difference
            is not noticeable. However for some purposes (e.g. very large, static
            billboards) the changing billboard orientation when rotating the camera
            can be off putting, therefore you can enable this option to use a
            more expensive, but more accurate version.

            This class defines the interface and the basic behaviour of a

            the scene, in conjunction with the render queue. This class is designed

            There is a distinction between 'objects' (which subclass <see cref="T:Engine.Renderer.MovableObject"/>, 
            and are movable, discrete objects in the world), and 'world geometry',
            which is large, generally static geometry. World geometry tends to 
            influence the SceneManager organisational structure (e.g. lots of indoor
            static geometry might result in a spatial tree structure) and as such
            world geometry is generally tied to a given SceneManager implementation,
            whilst <see cref="T:Engine.Renderer.MovableObject"/> instances can be used with any SceneManager.
            Subclasses are free to define world geometry however they please.

            <para>
            By default shadow casters are rendered into the shadow texture using
            an automatically generated fixed-function pass. This allows basic
            projective texture shadows, but it's possible to use more advanced
            shadow techniques by overriding the caster and receiver materials, for
            example providing vertex and fragment programs to implement shadow
            maps.

            Shadow techniques can be expensive, therefore it is a good idea

            and to skip the expense of rendering shadows for distance objects.

            Rendering back faces rather than front faces into a shadow texture

            won't need as much. For solid objects the result is the same anyway,
            if you have objects with holes you may want to turn this option off.

            The default implementation of texture shadows uses a fixed-function 
            colour texture projection approach for maximum compatibility, and 
            as such cannot support self-shadowing. However, if you decide to 
            implement a more complex shadowing technique using the 
            setShadowTextureCasterMaterial and setShadowTextureReceiverMaterial 
            there is a possibility you may be able to support 
            self-shadowing (e.g by implementing a shader-based shadow map). In 
            this case you might want to enable this option.

            This class handles a window into which the contents
            of a scene are rendered. There is a many-to-1 relationship
            between instances of this class an instance of RenderSystem
            which controls the rendering of the scene. There may be
            more than one window in the case of level editor tools etc.
            This class is abstract since there may be
            different implementations for different windowing systems.
            <para>
            Instances are created and communicated with by the render system
            although client programs can get a reference to it from
            the render system if required for resizing or moving.
            Note that you can have multiple viewpoints
            in the window for effects like rear-view mirrors and
            picture-in-picture views (see <see cref="T:Engine.Renderer.Viewport"/> and <see cref="T:Engine.Renderer.Camera"/>).

            A 'listener' is an interface designed to be called back when
            particular events are called. This class defines the
            interface relating to RenderTarget events. In order to receive
            notifications of RenderTarget events, you should create a subclass of
            RenderTargetListener and override the methods for which you would like
            to customise the resulting processing. You should then call
            RenderTarget.AddListener passing an instance of this class.
            There is no limit to the number of RenderTarget listeners you can register,
            allowing you to register multiple listeners for different purposes.

            <para>
            RenderTarget events occur before and after the target is updated as a whole,
            and before and after each viewport on that target is updated. Each RenderTarget
            holds it's own set of listeners, but you can register the same listener on
            multiple render targets if you like since the event contains details of the
            originating RenderTarget.

            <para>
            Rendering can be repeated with many passes for more complex effects.
            Each pass is either a fixed-function pass (meaning it does not use
            a vertex or fragment program) or a programmable pass (meaning it does
            use either a vertex and fragment program, or both). 
            </para>
            <para>
            Programmable passes are complex to define, because they require custom
            programs and you have to set all constant inputs to the programs (like
            the position of lights, any base material colors you wish to use etc), but
            they do give you much total flexibility over the algorithms used to render your
            pass, and you can create some effects which are impossible with a fixed-function pass.
            On the other hand, you can define a fixed-function pass in very little time, and
            you can use a range of fixed-function effects like environment mapping very
            easily, plus your pass will be more likely to be compatible with older hardware.
            There are pros and cons to both, just remember that if you use a programmable
            pass to create some great effects, allow more time for definition and testing.

            <remarks>
            <para>
            The default behaviour for a pass (when this option is 'false'), is
            for a pass to be rendered only once (or the number of times set in
            SetPassIterationCount), with all the lights which could
            affect this object set at the same time (up to the maximum lights
            allowed in the render system, which is typically 8).
            </para>
            <para>
            Setting this option to 'true' changes this behaviour, such that
            instead of trying to issue render this pass once per object, it
            is run <b>per light</b>, or for a group of 'n' lights each time
            which can affect this object, the number of
            times set in setPassIterationCount (default is once). In
            this case, only light index 0 is ever used, and is a different light
            every time the pass is issued, up to the total number of lights
            which is affecting this object. This has 2 advantages:
            <ul><li>There is no limit on the number of lights which can be
            supported</li>
            <li>It's easier to write vertex / fragment programs for this because
            a single program can be used for any number of lights</li>
            </ul>
            However, this technique is more expensive, and typically you
            will want an additional ambient pass, because if no lights are 
            affecting the object it will not be rendered at all, which will look
            odd even if ambient light is zero (imagine if there are lit objects
            behind it - the objects silhouette would not show up). Therefore,
            use this option with care, and you would be well advised to provide
            a less expensive fallback technique for use in the distance.
            </para>
            <para>
            The number of times this pass runs is still limited by the maximum
            number of lights allowed as set in SetMaxSimultaneousLights, so
            you will never get more passes than this. Also, the iteration is
            started from the 'start light' as set in Pass.SetStartLight, and
            the number of passes is the number of lights to iterate over divided
            by the number of lights per iteration (default 1, set by 
            SetLightCountPerIteration).

            <para>
            A typical way for the rendering engine to cull triangles is based on the 
            'vertex winding' of triangles. Vertex winding refers to the direction in 
            which the vertices are passed or indexed to in the rendering operation as 
            viewed from the camera, and will wither be clockwise or anticlockwise.
            The default is <b>CullingMode.Clockwise</b> i.e. that only triangles whose 
            vertices are passed/indexed in anticlockwise order are rendered - this is a common 
            approach and is used in 3D studio models for example. You can alter this 
            culling mode if you wish but it is not advised unless you know what you are doing.

            <remarks>
            <para>
            When using an additive lighting mode (shadow stencil additive or
            shadow texture additive), the scene is rendered in 3 discrete
            stages, ambient (or pre-lighting), per-light (once per light, with 
            shadowing) and decal (or post-lighting). Usually engine figures out how
            to categorise your passes automatically, but there are some effects you
            cannot achieve without manually controlling the illumination. For example
            specular effects are muted by the typical sequence because all textures
            are saved until the StencilShadowsIlluminationStage.Decal stage which mutes the 
            specular effect. 
            Instead, you could do texturing within the per-light stage if it's
            possible for your material and thus add the specular on after the
            decal texturing, and have no post-light rendering.
            </para>
            <para>
            If you assign an illumination stage to a pass you have to assign it
            to all passes in the technique otherwise it will be ignored. Also note
            that whilst you can have more than one pass in each group, they cannot
            alternate, ie all ambient passes will be before all per-light passes, 
            which will also be before all decal passes. Within their categories
            the passes will retain their ordering though.

            <remarks>
            <para>
            Particle emitters are the sources of particles in a particle system. 
            This class defines the ParticleEmitter interface, and provides a basic implementation 
            for tasks which most emitters will do (these are of course overridable).
            Particle emitters can be  grouped into types, e.g. 'point' emitters, 'box' emitters etc; each type will 
            create particles with a different starting point, direction and velocity (although
            within the types you can configure the ranges of these parameters). 
            </para>
            <para>
            Because there are so many types of emitters you could use, Engine chooses not to dictate
            the available types. It comes with some in-built, but allows plugins or applications to extend the emitter types available.
            This is done by subclassing ParticleEmitter to have the appropriate emission behaviour you want,
            and also creating a subclass of ParticleEmitterFactory which is responsible for creating instances 
            of your new emitter type. You register this factory with the ParticleSystemManager using
            addEmitterFactory, and from then on emitters of this type can be created either from code or through
            text particle scripts by naming the type.
            </para>
            <para>
            This same approach is used for ParticleAffectors (which modify existing particles per frame).
            This means that Engine is particularly flexible when it comes to creating particle system effects,
            with literally infinite combinations of emitter and affector types, and paramters within those
            types.

            Most emitters will have a base direction in which they emit particles (those which
            emit in all directions will ignore this parameter). They may not emit exactly along this
            vector for every particle, many will introduce a random scatter around this vector using 
            the angle property.

            <remarks>
            Whilst the direction property defines the general direction of emission for particles, 
            this property defines how far the emission angle can deviate away from this base direction.
            This allows you to create a scatter effect - if set to 0, all particles will be emitted
            exactly along the emitters direction vector, wheras if you set it to 180 degrees or more,
            particles will be emitted in a sphere, i.e. in all directions.

            This method tells the emitter how many particles per second should be emitted. The emitter
            subclass does not have to emit these in a continuous burst - this is a relative parameter
            and the emitter may choose to emit all of the second's worth of particles every half-second
            for example. This is controlled by the emitter's GetEmissionCount method.

            The <see cref="P:Engine.Renderer.MeshObject.Mesh"/> and <see cref="T:Engine.Renderer.SubMesh"/> classes deal with the 
            definition of the geometry
            used by discrete movable objects. Objects are actual instances of
            objects based on this geometry in the world. Therefore there is
            usually a single set <see cref="P:Engine.Renderer.MeshObject.Mesh"/> for a car, but there may be multiple

            Viewport class, i.e. a rendering region on a render target.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            A viewport is the meeting of a camera and a rendering surface -
            the camera renders the scene from a viewpoint, and places its
            results into some subset of a rendering target, which may be the
            whole surface or just a part of the surface. Each viewport has a
            single camera as source and a single target as destination. A
            camera only has 1 viewport, but a render target may have several.
            A viewport also has a Z-order, i.e. if there is more than one
            viewport on a single render target and they overlap, one must
            obscure the other in some predetermined way.

            Field Of View (FOV) is the angle made between the frustum's position, and the edges
            of the 'screen' onto which the scene is projected. High values (90+ degrees) result in a wide-angle,
            fish-eye kind of view, low values (30- degrees) in a stretched, telescopic kind of view. Typical values
            are between 45 and 60 degrees.

            The position of the near clipping plane is the distance from the frustums position to the screen

            aspect ratio, determines the size of the viewport through which the world is viewed (in world
            co-ordinates). Note that this world viewport is different to a screen viewport, which has it's
            dimensions expressed in pixels. The frustums viewport should have the same aspect ratio as the
            screen viewport it renders into to avoid distortion.

            <para>
            The view frustrum is a pyramid created from the frustum 
            position and the edges of the viewport.
            This method sets the distance for the far end of that pyramid. 
            Different applications need different values: e.g. a flight sim
            needs a much further far clipping plane than a first-person 
            shooter. An important point here is that the larger the ratio 
            between near and far clipping planes, the lower the accuracy of
            the Z-buffer used to depth-cue pixels. This is because the
            Z-range is limited to the size of the Z buffer (16 or 32-bit) 
            and the max values must be spread over the gap between near and
            far clip planes. As it happens, you can affect the accuracy far 
            more by altering the near distance rather than the far distance, 
            but keep this in mind.

            Class encapsulates rendering properties of an object.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            Engine's material class encapsulates ALL aspects of the visual appearance,
            of an object. It also includes other flags which 
            might not be traditionally thought of as material properties such as 
            culling modes and depth buffer settings, but these affect the 
            appearance of the rendered object and are convenient to attach to the 
            material since it keeps all the settings in one place. This is 
            different to Direct3D which treats a material as just the colour 
            components (diffuse, specular) and not texture maps etc. An Engine 
            Material can be thought of as equivalent to a 'Shader'.
            </para>
            <para>
            A Material can be rendered in multiple different ways depending on the
            hardware available. You may configure a Material to use high-complexity
            fragment shaders, but these won't work on every card; therefore a Technique
            is an approach to creating the visual effect you are looking for. You are advised
            to create fallback techniques with lower hardware requirements if you decide to
            use advanced features. In addition, you also might want lower-detail techniques
            for distant geometry.
            </para>
            <para>
            Each technique can be made up of multiple passes. A fixed-function pass
            may combine multiple texture layers using multitexrtuing, but Engine can 
            break that into multiple passes automatically if the active card cannot
            handle that many simultaneous textures. Programmable passes, however, cannot
            be split down automatically, so if the active graphics card cannot handle the
            technique which contains these passes, Engine will try to find another technique
            which the card can do. If, at the end of the day, the card cannot handle any of the
            techniques which are listed for the material, the engine will render the 
            geometry plain white, which should alert you to the problem.
            </para>
            <para>
            Engine comes configured with a number of default settings for a newly

            SceneManager.GetDefaultMaterialSettings. Any changes you make to the 
            Material returned from this method will apply to any materials created 
            from this point onward.

            A Technique is a single way of rendering geometry in order to achieve the effect
            you are intending in a material. There are many reason why you would want more than
            one - the main one being to handle variable graphics card abilities; you might have
            one technique which is impressive but only runs on 4th-generation graphics cards, 
            for example. In this case you will want to create at least one fallback Technique.
            Engine will work out which Techniques a card can support and pick the best one.
            </para>
            <para>
            If multiple Techniques are available, the order in which they are created is 
            important - the engine will consider lower-indexed Techniques to be preferable
            to higher-indexed Techniques, ie when asked for the 'best' technique it will
            return the first one in the technique list which is supported by the hardware.

            So how does this animate a mesh? Well every vertex in a mesh is assigned to one or more
            bones which affects it's position when the bone is moved. If a vertex is assigned to 
            more than one bone, then weights must be assigned to determine how much each bone affects
            the vertex (actually a weight of 1.0 is used for single bone assignments). 
            Weighted vertex assignments are especially useful around the joints themselves
            to avoid 'pinching' of the mesh in this region. 
            </para>
            <para>
            Therefore by moving the skeleton using preset animations, we can animate the mesh. The
            advantage of using skeletal animation is that you store less animation data, especially
            as vertex counts increase. In addition, you are able to blend multiple animations together
            (e.g. walking and looking around, running and shooting) and provide smooth transitions
            between animations without incurring as much of an overhead as would be involved if you
            did this on the core vertex data.

            <para>
            Skeleton definitions are loaded from datafiles, namely the .skeleton file format. They
            are loaded on demand, especially when referenced by a Mesh.

            A skeleton is bound to a mesh in a binding pose. Bone positions are then modified from this

        <member name="T:Engine.Renderer.RenderQueueInvocation">
            <summary>
            Class representing the invocation of queue groups in a render queue.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            The default behaviour for Engine's render queue is to render each queue
            group in turn, dealing with shadows automatically, and rendering solids
            in grouped passes, followed by transparent objects in descending order.
            This class, together with RenderQueueInvocationSequence and the ability
            to associate one with a <see cref="T:Engine.Renderer.Viewport"/>, allows you to change that behaviour
            and render queue groups in arbitrary sequence, repeatedly, and to skip
            shadows, change the ordering of solids, or even prevent Engine controlling
            the render state during a particular invocation for special effects.
            </para>
            <para>
            Note that whilst you can change the ordering of rendering solids, you 
            cannot change the ordering on transparent objects, since to do this would
            cause them to render incorrectly.
            </para>
            <para>
            As well as using this class directly and using the options it provides you
            with, you can also provide subclasses of it to a 
            <see cref="T:Engine.Renderer.RenderQueueInvocationSequence"/> instance if you want to gain ultimate control.
            </para>
            <para>
            Invocations will be skipped if there are scene-level options preventing
            them being rendered - for example special-case render queues and
            render queue listeners that dictate this.

            When loaded from a script, a Material is in an 'unloaded' state and only stores the settings
            required. It does not at that stage load any textures. This is because the material settings may be
            loaded 'en masse' from bulk material script files, but only a subset will actually be required.

            <para>
            The Engine render queue is divided into several queue groups, as defined by
            uint8. A class may implement this interface, and register itself as a listener by calling 
            <see cref="M:Engine.Renderer.SceneManager.AddRenderQueueListener(Engine.Renderer.RenderQueueListener)"/>. After doing so,
            the class will receive an event before and after each queue group is sent to 
            the rendering system.
            </para>
            <para>
            The event listeners have an option to make a queue either be skipped, or to repeat.
            Note that if multiple listeners are registered, the one registered last has the final
            say, although options set by previous listeners will not be changed if the latest
            does not express a preference.

            <summary>A billboard is a primitive which always faces the camera in every frame.</summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            Billboards can be used for special effects or some other trickery which requires the
            triangles to always facing the camera no matter where it is. Engine groups billboards into
            sets for efficiency, so you should never create a billboard on it's own (it's ok to have a
            set of one if you need it).
            </para>
            <para>
            Billboards have their geometry generated every frame depending on where the camera is. It is most
            beneficial for all billboards in a set to be identically sized since Engine can take advantage of this and
            save some calculations - useful when you have sets of hundreds of billboards as is possible with special
            effects. You can deviate from this if you wish (example: a smoke effect would probably have smoke puffs
            expanding as they rise, so each billboard will legitimately have it's own size) but be aware the extra
            overhead this brings and try to avoid it if you can.
            </para>
            <para>
            Billboards are just the mechanism for rendering a range of effects such as particles. It is other classes
            which use billboards to create their individual effects, so the methods here are quite generic.

            Note that it is most efficient for every billboard in a <see cref="T:Engine.Renderer.BillboardSet"/> to have the same dimensions. If you
            choose to alter the dimensions of an individual billboard the set will be less efficient. Do not call
            this method unless you really need to have different billboard dimensions within the same set.

            <para>
            Lights are added to the scene like any other object. They contain various
            parameters like type, position, attenuation (how light intensity fades with
            distance), color etc.
            </para>
            <para>
            The defaults when a light is created is pure white diffues light, with no
            attenuation (does not decrease with distance) and a range of 1000 world units.
            </para>
            <para>
            Lights are created by using the <see cref="M:Engine.Renderer.SceneManager.CreateLight"/> method. They can subsequently be
            added to a <see cref="T:Engine.Renderer.SceneNode"/> if required to allow them to move relative to a node in the scene. A light attached
            to a SceneNode is assumed to havea base position of (0,0,0) and a direction of (0,0,1) before modification
            by the SceneNode's own orientation. If not attached to a <see cref="T:Engine.Renderer.SceneNode"/>,
            the light's position and direction is as set using setPosition and setDirection.
            </para>
            <para>
            Remember also that dynamic lights rely on modifying the color of vertices based on the position of
            the light compared to an object's vertex normals. Dynamic lighting will only look good if the
            object being lit has a fair level of tesselation and the normals are properly set. This is particularly
            true for the spotlight which will only look right on highly tesselated models. In the future Engine may be
            extended for certain scene types so an alternative to the standard dynamic lighting may be used, such
            as dynamic lightmaps.

            A program can be set up with a list of default parameters, which can save time when

            any new parameter objects created from this program afterwards will automatically include
            the default parameters; thus users of the program need only change the parameters
            which are unique to their own usage of the program.

            The default Particle system update interval, based on elapsed frame time,

            By using this option, you can make the particle system update at

            is.
            </para>
            <para>
            When iteration interval is set to zero, it means the update occurs based

            <remarks>
            The number of particles active in a system at a point in time depends on 
            the number of emitters, their emission rates, the time-to-live (TTL) each particle is
            given on emission (and whether any affectors modify that TTL) and the maximum

            <para>
            This class holds the data used to represent a discrete
            3-dimensional object. Mesh data usually contains more
            than just vertices and triangle information; it also
            includes references to materials (and the faces which use them),
            level-of-detail reduction information, convex hull definition,
            skeleton/bones information, keyframe animation etc.
            However, it is important to note the emphasis on the word
            'discrete' here. This class does not cover the large-scale
            sprawling geometry found in level / landscape data.
            </para>
            <para>
            Multiple world objects can (indeed should) be created from a
            single mesh object - see the <see cref="T:Engine.Renderer.MeshObject"/> class for more info.
            The mesh object will have it's own default
            material properties, but potentially each world instance may
            wish to customise the materials from the original. When the object
            is instantiated into a scene node, the mesh material properties
            will be taken by default but may be changed. These properties
            are actually held at the <see cref="T:Engine.Renderer.SubMesh"/> level since a single mesh may
            have parts with different materials.
            </para>
            <para>
            As described above, because the mesh may have sections of differing
            material properties, a mesh is inherently a compound contruct,
            consisting of one or more <see cref="T:Engine.Renderer.SubMesh"/> objects.
            However, it strongly 'owns' it's SubMeshes such that they
            are loaded / unloaded at the same time. This is contrary to
            the approach taken to hierarchically related (but loosely owned)
            scene nodes, where data is loaded / unloaded separately. Note
            also that mesh sub-sections (when used in an instantiated object)
            share the same scene node as the parent.

            Tangent vectors are vectors representing the local 'X' axis for a given vertex based

            of existing normals, and from the 2D texture coordinates already baked into the model.
            They can be used for a number of things, but most of all they are useful for 
            vertex and fragment programs, when you wish to arrive at a common space for doing

            <para>
            There are 2 ways that you can create level-of-detail (LOD) versions of a mesh;
            the first is to call this method, which does fairly extensive calculations to
            work out how to simplify the mesh whilst having the minimum affect on the model.
            The alternative is to actually create simpler versions of the mesh yourself in 
            a modelling tool, and having exported them, tell the 'master' mesh to use these
            alternative meshes for lower detail versions; this is done by calling the 
            createManualLodLevel method.
            </para>
            <para>
            As well as creating the lower detail versions of the mesh, this method will
            also associate them with depth values. As soon as an object is at least as far
            away from the camera as the depth value associated with it's LOD, it will drop 
            to that level of detail.

            <remarks>
            As an alternative to generating lower level of detail versions of a mesh, you can
            use your own manually modelled meshes as lower level versions. This lets you 
            have complete control over the LOD, and in addition lets you scale down other
            aspects of the model which cannot be done using the generated method; for example, 
            you could use less detailed materials and / or use less bones in the skeleton if
            this is an animated mesh. Therefore for complex models you are likely to be better off
            modelling your LODs yourself and using this method, whilst for models with fairly
            simple materials and no animation you can just use the generateLodLevels method.

            This method prepares the mesh for generating a renderable shadow volume.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            Preparing a mesh to generate a shadow volume involves firstly ensuring that the 
            vertex buffer containing the positions for the mesh is a standalone vertex buffer,
            with no other components in it. This method will therefore break apart any existing
            vertex buffers this mesh holds if position is sharing a vertex buffer. 
            Secondly, it will double the size of this vertex buffer so that there are 2 copies of 
            the position data for the mesh. The first half is used for the original, and the second 
            half is used for the 'extruded' version of the mesh. The vertex count of the main 
            <see cref="T:Engine.Renderer.VertexData"/> used to render the mesh will remain the same though, 
            so as not to add any overhead to regular rendering of the object.
            Both copies of the position are required in one buffer because shadow volumes stretch 
            from the original mesh to the extruded version. 
            </para>
            <para>
            Because shadow volumes are rendered in turn, no additional
            index buffer space is allocated by this method, a shared index buffer allocated by the
            shadow rendering algorithm is used for addressing this extended vertex buffer.

            <remarks>
            This class deals with the runtime management of
            skeleton data; like other resource managers it handles
            the creation of resources (in this case skeleton data),
            working within a fixed memory budget.

            <remarks>
            <para>
            Different types of GPU programs support different types of constant parameters.
            For example, it's relatively common to find that vertex programs only support
            floating point constants, and that fragment programs only support integer (fixed point)
            parameters. This can vary depending on the program version supported by the
            graphics card being used. You should consult the documentation for the type of
            low level program you are using, or alternatively use the methods
            provided on RenderSystemCapabilities to determine the options.
            </para>
            <para>
            Another possible limitation is that some systems only allow constants to be set
            on certain boundaries, e.g. in sets of 4 values for example. Again, see
            RenderSystemCapabilities for full details.
            </para>
            <para>

            Some systems only allow constants to be set on certain boundaries, 
            e.g. in sets of 4 values for example. The 'multiple' parameter allows
            you to control that although you should only change it if you know
            your chosen language supports that (at the time of writing, only
            GLSL allows constants which are not a multiple of 4).

            This singleton class is responsible for creating and managing particle 
            systems. All particle systems must be created and destroyed using this 
            object, although the user interface to creating them is via
            <see cref="T:Engine.Renderer.SceneManager"/>. Remember that like all other <see cref="T:Engine.Renderer.MovableObject"/>
            subclasses, ParticleSystems do not get rendered until they are 
            attached to a <see cref="T:Engine.Renderer.SceneNode"/> object.

            This class also manages factories for <see cref="T:Engine.Renderer.ParticleEmitter"/> and 
            <see cref="T:Engine.Renderer.ParticleAffector"/> classes. To enable easy extensions to the types of 
            emitters (particle sources) and affectors (particle modifiers), the
            ParticleSystemManager lets plugins or applications register factory 
            classes which submit new subclasses to <see cref="T:Engine.Renderer.ParticleEmitter"/> and 
            <see cref="T:Engine.Renderer.ParticleAffector"/>. Engine comes with a number of them already provided,
            such as cone, sphere and box-shaped emitters, and simple affectors such
            as constant directional force and colour faders. However using this 
            registration process, a plugin can create any behaviour required.

            This class also manages the loading and parsing of particle system

            <remarks>
            <para>
            Engine renders scenes from a camera viewpoint into a buffer of
            some sort, normally a window or a texture (a subclass of
            <see cref="T:Engine.Renderer.RenderTarget"/>).
            Engine cameras support both perspective projection (the default,
            meaning objects get smaller the further away they are) and
            orthographic projection (blueprint-style, no decrease in size
            with distance). Each camera carries with it a style of rendering,
            e.g. full textured, flat shaded, wireframe), field of view,
            rendering distances etc, allowing you to use Engine to create
            complex multi-window views if required. In addition, more than
            one camera can point at a single render target if required,
            each rendering to a subset of the target, allowing split screen
            and picture-in-picture views.
            </para>
            <para>
            Cameras maintain their own aspect ratios, field of view, and frustrum,
            and project co-ordinates into a space measured from -1 to 1 in x and y,
            and 0 to 1 in z. At render time, the camera will be rendering to a
            Viewport which will translate these parametric co-ordinates into real screen
            co-ordinates. Obviously it is advisable that the viewport has the same
            aspect ratio as the camera to avoid distortion (unless you want it!).
            </para>
            <para>
            Note that a Camera can be attached to a <see cref="T:Engine.Renderer.SceneNode"/>, using the method
            <see cref="M:Engine.Renderer.SceneNode.Attach(Engine.Renderer.MovableObject)"/>. If this is done the Camera will combine it's own
            position/orientation settings with it's parent <see cref="T:Engine.Renderer.SceneNode"/>. 
            This is useful for implementing more complex Camera / object
            relationships i.e. having a camera attached to a world object.

            <para>
            The default sort of billboard (<b>Point</b>), always has both x and y axes parallel to 
            the camera's local axes. This is fine for 'point' style billboards (e.g. flares,
            smoke, anything which is symmetrical about a central point) but does not look good for
            billboards which have an orientation (e.g. an elongated raindrop). In this case, the
            oriented billboards are more suitable (<b>OrientedCommon</b> or <b>OrientedSelf</b>) since
            they retain an independant Y axis and only the X axis is generated, perpendicular to both
            the local Y and the camera Z.
            </para>
            <para>
            In some case you might want the billboard has fixed Z axis and doesn't need to face to
            camera (e.g. an aureola around the player and parallel to the ground). You can use
            <b>PerpendicularSelf</b> which the billboard plane perpendicular to the billboard own
            direction. Or <b>PerpendicularCommon</b> which the billboard plane perpendicular to the
            common direction.
            </para>
            <para>
            <b>PerpendicularSelf</b> and <b>PerpendicularCommon</b> cannot guarantee 
            counterclockwise, you might use double-side material 
            (<b>cull_hardware node</b>) to ensure no billboard are culled.

            it could mean the center of the bottom edge (e.g. a tree which is positioned on the ground),
            the top-left corner (e.g. a cursor).

            By default a billboardset is rendered by generating geometry for a

            orientation settings, and uploading it to the video card. 
            The alternative is to use hardware point rendering, which means that
            only one position needs to be sent per billboard rather than 4 and
            the hardware sorts out how this is rendered based on the render
            state.

            <remarks>
            The RenderSystem class provides a base interface

            e.g. Direct3D or OpenGL. Whilst a few of the general
            methods have implementations, most of this class is
            abstract, requiring a subclass based on a specific API
            to be constructed to provide the full functionality.

            This method creates a standard <see cref="T:Engine.Renderer.AnimationTrack"/>, but also 
            associates it with a target <see cref="T:Engine.Renderer.Bone"/> which will receive all 
            keyframe effects.
